Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

## How do I **build on the fly** like `jekyll serve`?

Use `find | entr sh -c 'make'` to build when files have changed. In addition,
replace `make` with `pkill surf` or kill the surf pid to reload the browser
on the fly.

## How do I put my site following this directory and test it?

Replace `$(TARG)` with `_site` (directories with `_` are ignored). Enter the
directory `_site`, run `python -m http.server` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
in a browser.

## How do I check for **link rot** directed to my site?

Use `wget --no-proxy --spider -r -nH -nd -np -nv -e robots=off -p ${HOST}`,
note that this doesn't work on checking link directing to other domains.

## How do I build it together with a few slow computers (cluster computing)?

I am still researching this.
