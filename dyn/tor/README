Check if the client is using Tor by using Tor's microdescriptors and return a
css file. `torcheck.py` is the prototype which uses uwsgi. `torcheck.c` take
over the wsgi script by using CGI with FastCGI.

Cronjob to update the Tor's microdescriptors:

    0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/torlist.sh

`update.py` is the prototype to parse the microdescriptors which is superseeded
by `update.c`. It is used with `wget` (mirror site) in `torlist.sh`.

Run `make` to build `torcheck` and `torlist`.
