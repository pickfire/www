Simple Tools for Development Environment
========================================
Development environment accustomed to me. [pickfire's dotfiles](//git.pickfire.tk/dotfiles)

Window Manager
--------------
Tiling window manager, I like [dwm][dwm].

### dwmstatus
Simple status bar for [dwm][dwm], not click-able, not colour-able. Use a simple
C script to lower the processing cost as it runs every second. Current status:

    ♪ 100% ⚡ AC │ ↓ 1.2k ↓ 0 │ / 80% ~ 70% │ 0.12 │ Mon Fed 28 00:00:00

[dwm]: //dwm.suckless.org

Terminal
--------
I use [st](//st.suckless.org) as it is fast and support true colors (my
ultimate motive).

Editor
------
#### **Note: I am not a participatant of the editor wars, I use vi-like keys just to prevent _»little-finger ache«_**

[neovim](//neovim.org) as a stylish vi-editor with fast
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as the plugin manager.
