Flashing and Rooting RedMi Note 3
=================================

I have wanted to root the RedMi Note 3 （红米3）. Looking into the tutorials
online, rooting with Linux for RedMi Note 3 does not seem to be an easy task.

Some useful guides helps, [unofficial rooting][twrp] and [miui thread][miui].
Hope this guide helps in flash + root RedMi Note 3 officially with Linux. ^^

How I root? Unlock the bootloader officially, flash with china developer rom
and then root it. Does it really worth it? The official su sucks so nope. :(

**Important**: Read this first, please note that Microsoft Windows is needed
for unlocking the bootloader for MiFlashUnlock, tried wine but does not work.
