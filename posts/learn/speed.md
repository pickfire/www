Let's break the time barrier
============================
Practise simple task that can help you to improve your daily performance.
Always remember:

> Practice makes perfect!

Time tracking
=============
Pomodoro Timer™, https://github.com/pickfire/spt

Ambidextrous
============
##### **Note: This method that I am using won't work for chinese characters**

One hand for (what rhymes with performance), two hands for performance.
Writing with two hands can have huge performance gain, just make sure you
practise it once in a while.

1. Lines, geometry
2. Mirror
3. Duplicate
4. Rhythm
5. Speed

#### Touch Typing (Easy Job)
Learn to type with all fingers that you have without looking, that's how the
keyboard is designed.

Meditate
========
Refresh your mind and purify your soul. Do only (and nothing else):

1. Breathe
2. Breathe
3. Breathe

A simple technique, do count from 10 to 1 and recount from 10 to 1.
A harder technique, do visualise yourself in a white dimension, safe and sound.

Rapid Reading
=============
How to get from reading 200 words per minute to 500+ words per minutes

- Reduce distraction, it is better to close your ears when you read
- Move your eyes slowly, if you can't use your finger as a pointer
- Avoid sub-vocalization
  - do not `see -> hear -> understand`
  - instead `see -> understand`
- Avoid regression - don't read the word "Avoid regression" again
- Read words in chunk, eg. "read all of these words in chunk"

Day of Week
===========
Calculate the day of week (星期) using three fingers.
```

<style>
tr td:nth-child(even) { background-color: #EEE; }
td { padding: 1ex; }
</style>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr>
    <td>星期</td><td>一</td><td>二</td><td>三</td><td>四</td><td>五</td><td>六</td><td>日</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week</td><td>Monday</td><td>Tuesday</td><td>Wednesday</td><td>Thursday</td><td>Friday</td><td>Saturday</td><td>Sunday</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I will normally point my thumb to the part of the day of the week and do calculations:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>day</td>
  </tr>
</table>
